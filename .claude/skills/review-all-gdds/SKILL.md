# Review All GDDs

This skill reads every system GDD simultaneously and performs two complementary
reviews that cannot be done per-GDD in isolation:

1. **Cross-GDD Consistency** — contradictions, stale references, and ownership
   conflicts between documents
2. **Game Design Holism** — issues that only emerge when you see all systems
   together: dominant strategies, broken economies, cognitive overload, pillar
   drift, competing progression loops

**This is distinct from `/design-review`**, which reviews one GDD for internal
completeness. This skill reviews the *relationships* between all GDDs.

**When to run:**
- After all MVP-tier GDDs are individually approved
- After any GDD is significantly revised mid-production
- Before `/create-architecture` begins (architecture built on inconsistent GDDs
  inherits those inconsistencies)

**Argument modes:**
- **No argument / `full`**: Both consistency and design theory passes
- **`consistency`**: Cross-GDD consistency checks only (faster)
- **`design-theory`**: Game design holism checks only
- **`since-last-review`**: Only GDDs modified since the last review report (git-based)

---

## Phase 1: Load Everything

Read all design documents before any analysis:

1. `design/gdd/game-concept.md` — game vision, core loop, MVP definition
2. `design/gdd/game-pillars.md` if it exists — design pillars and anti-pillars
3. `design/gdd/systems-index.md` — authoritative system list, layers, dependencies, status
4. **Every system GDD in `design/gdd/`** — read completely (skip game-concept.md
   and systems-index.md — those are read above)

For `since-last-review` mode: run `git log --name-only` to identify GDDs
modified since the last review report file was written. Only load those GDDs
plus any GDDs they depend on.

Report: "Loaded [N] system GDDs covering [M] systems. Pillars: [list]. Anti-pillars: [list]."

If fewer than 2 system GDDs exist, stop:
> "Cross-GDD review requires at least 2 system GDDs. Write more GDDs first,
> then re-run `/review-all-gdds`."

---

## Phase 2: Cross-GDD Consistency

Work through every pair and group of GDDs to find contradictions and gaps.

### 2a: Dependency Bidirectionality

For every GDD's Dependencies section, check that every listed dependency is
reciprocal:
- If GDD-A lists "depends on GDD-B", check that GDD-B lists GDD-A as a dependent
- If GDD-A lists "depended on by GDD-C", check that GDD-C lists GDD-A as a dependency
- Flag any one-directional dependency as a consistency issue

```
⚠️  Dependency Asymmetry
combat.md lists: Depends On → health-system.md
health-system.md does NOT list combat.md as a dependent
→ One of these documents has a stale dependency section
```

### 2b: Rule Contradictions

For each game rule, mechanic, or constraint defined in any GDD, check whether
any other GDD defines a contradicting rule for the same situation:

Categories to scan:
- **Health and damage**: Does any GDD say damage floor is 1? Does any other say
  armour can reduce damage to 0? These contradict.
- **Resource ownership**: If two GDDs both define how a shared resource (gold,
  stamina, mana) accumulates or depletes, do they agree?
- **State transitions**: If GDD-A describes what happens when a character dies,
  does GDD-B's description of the same event agree?
- **Timing**: If GDD-A says "X happens on the same frame", does GDD-B assume
  it happens asynchronously?
- **Stacking rules**: If GDD-A says status effects stack, does GDD-B assume
  they don't?

```
🔴 Rule Contradiction
combat.md: "Minimum damage after armour reduction is 1"
status-effects.md: "Poison ignores armour and can reduce health by any amount,
  including to 0"
→ These rules directly contradict. Which GDD is authoritative?
```

### 2c: Stale References

For every cross-document reference (GDD-A mentions a mechanic, value, or
system name from GDD-B), verify the referenced element still exists in GDD-B
with the same name and behaviour:

- If GDD-A says "combo multiplier from the combat system feeds into score", check
  that the combat GDD actually defines a combo multiplier that outputs to score
- If GDD-A references "the XP curve defined in progression.md", check that
  progression.md actually has an XP curve, not a flat-level system
- If GDD-A was written before GDD-B and assumed a mechanic that GDD-B later
  designed differently, flag GDD-A as containing a stale reference

```
⚠️  Stale Reference
inventory.md (written first): "Item weight uses the encumbrance formula
  from movement.md"
movement.md (written later): Defines no encumbrance formula — uses a flat
  carry limit instead
→ inventory.md references a formula that doesn't exist
```

### 2d: Data and Tuning Knob Ownership Conflicts

Two GDDs should not both claim to own the same data or tuning knob. Scan all
Tuning Knobs sections across all GDDs and flag duplicates:

```
⚠️  Ownership Conflict
combat.md Tuning Knobs: "base_damage_multiplier — controls damage scaling"
progression.md Tuning Knobs: "damage_multiplier — scales with player level"
→ Two GDDs define multipliers on the same output. Which owns the final value?
  This will produce either a double-application bug or a design conflict.
```

### 2e: Formula Compatibility

For GDDs whose formulas are connected (output of one feeds input of another),
check that the output range of the upstream formula is within the expected
input range of the downstream formula:

- If combat.md outputs damage values between 1–500, and the health system is
  designed for health values between 10–100, a one-hit kill is almost always
  possible — is that intended?
- If the economy GDD expects item prices between 1–1000 gold, and the
  progression GDD generates gold at a rate of 50–5000 per session, the
  economy will either be trivially easy or permanently locked — is that intended?

Flag incompatibilities as CONCERNS (design judgment needed, not necessarily wrong):

```
⚠️  Formula Range Mismatch
combat.md: Max damage output = 500 (at max level, max gear)
health-system.md: Base player health = 100, max health = 250
→ Late-game combat can one-shot a max-health player in a single hit.
  Is this intentional? If not, either damage ceiling or health ceiling needs adjustment.
```

### 2f: Acceptance Criteria Cross-Check

Scan Acceptance Criteria sections across all GDDs for contradictions:

- GDD-A criteria: "Player cannot die from a single hit"
- GDD-B criteria: "Boss attack deals 150% of player max health"
These acceptance criteria cannot both pass simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3: Game Design Holism

Review all GDDs together through the lens of game design theory and player
psychology. These are issues that individual GDD reviews cannot catch because
they require seeing all systems at once.

### 3a: Progression Loop Competition

A game should have one dominant progression loop that players feel is "the
point" of the game, with supporting loops that feed into it. When multiple
systems compete equally as the primary progression driver, players don't know
what the game is about.

Scan all GDDs for systems that:
- Award the player's primary resource (XP, levels, prestige, unlocks)
- Define themselves as the "core" or "main" loop
- Have comparable depth and time investment to other systems doing the same

```
⚠️  Competing Progression Loops
combat.md: Awards XP, unlocks abilities, is described as "the core loop"
crafting.md: Awards XP, unlocks recipes, is described as "the primary activity"
exploration.md: Awards XP, unlocks map areas, described as "the main driver"
→ Three systems all claim to be the primary progression loop and all award
  the same primary currency. Players will optimise one and ignore the others.
  Consider: one primary loop with the others as support systems.
```

### 3b: Player Attention Budget

Count how many systems require active player attention simultaneously during
a typical session. Each actively-managed system costs attention:

- Active = player must make decisions about this system regularly during play
- Passive = system runs automatically, player sees results but doesn't manage it

More than 3-4 simultaneously active systems creates cognitive overload for most
players. Present the count and flag if it exceeds 4 concurrent active systems:

```
⚠️  Cognitive Load Risk
Simultaneously active systems during combat:
  1. combat.md — combat decisions (active)
  2. stamina-system.md — stamina management (active)
  3. status-effects.md — status tracking (active)
  4. inventory.md — mid-combat item use (active)
  5. ability-system.md — ability cooldown management (active)
  6. companion-ai.md — companion command decisions (active)
→ 6 simultaneously active systems during the core loop.
  Research suggests 3-4 is the comfortable limit for most players.
  Consider: which of these can be made passive or simplified?
```

### 3c: Dominant Strategy Detection

A dominant strategy makes other strategies irrelevant — players discover it,
use it exclusively, and find the rest of the game boring. Look for:

- **Resource monopolies**: One strategy generates a resource significantly
  faster than all others
- **Risk-free power**: A strategy that is both high-reward and low-risk
  (if high-risk strategies exist, they need proportionally higher reward)
- **No trade-offs**: An option that is superior in all dimensions to all others
- **Obvious optimal path**: If any progression choice is "clearly correct",
  the others aren't real choices

```
⚠️  Potential Dominant Strategy
combat.md: Ranged attacks deal 80% of melee damage with no risk
combat.md: Melee attacks deal 100% damage but require close range
→ Unless melee has a significant compensating advantage (AOE, stagger,
  resource regeneration), ranged is dominant — higher safety, only 20% less
  damage. Consider what melee offers that ranged cannot.
```

### 3d: Economic Loop Analysis

Identify all resources across all GDDs (gold, XP, crafting materials, stamina,
health, mana, etc.). For each resource, map its **sources** (how players gain
it) and **sinks** (how players spend it).

Flag dangerous economic conditions:

| Condition | Sign | Risk |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Infinite source, no sink** | Resource accumulates indefinitely | Late game becomes trivially easy |
| **Sink, no source** | Resource drains to zero | System becomes unavailable |
| **Source >> Sink** | Surplus accumulates | Resource becomes meaningless |
| **Sink >> Source** | Constant scarcity | Frustration and gatekeeping |
| **Positive feedback loop** | More resource → easier to earn more | Runaway leader, snowball |
| **No catch-up** | Falling behind accelerates deficit | Unrecoverable states |

```
🔴 Economic Imbalance: Unbounded Positive Feedback
gold economy:
  Sources: monster drops (scales with player power), merchant selling (unlimited)
  Sinks: equipment purchase (one-time), ability upgrades (finite count)
→ After equipment and abilities are purchased, gold has no sink.
  Infinite surplus. Gold becomes meaningless mid-game.
  Add ongoing gold sinks (upkeep, consumables, cosmetics, gambling).
```

### 3e: Difficulty Curve Consistency

When multiple systems scale with player progression, they must scale in
compatible directions and at compatible rates. Mismatched scaling curves
create unintended difficulty spikes or trivialisations.

For each system that scales over time, extract:
- What scales (enemy health, player damage, resource cost, area size)
- How it scales (linear, exponential, stepped)
- When it scales (level, time, area)

Compare all scaling curves. Flag mismatches:

```
⚠️  Difficulty Curve Mismatch
combat.md: Enemy health scales exponentially with area (×2 per area)
progression.md: Player damage scales linearly with level (+10% per level)
→ By area 5, enemies have 32× base health; player deals ~1.5× base damage.
  The gap widens indefinitely. Late areas will become inaccessibly difficult
  unless the curves are reconciled.
```

### 3f: Pillar Alignment

Every system should clearly serve at least one design pillar. A system that
serves no pillar is "scope creep by design" — it's in the game but not in
service of what the game is trying to be.

For each GDD system, check its Player Fantasy section against the design pillars.
Flag any system whose stated fantasy doesn't map to any pillar:

```
⚠️  Pillar Drift
fishing-system.md: Player Fantasy — "peaceful, meditative activity"
Pillars: "Brutal Combat", "Tense Survival", "Emergent Stories"
→ The fishing system serves none of the three pillars. Either add a pillar
  that covers it, redesign it to serve an existing pillar, or cut it.
```

Also check anti-pillars — flag any system that does what an anti-pillar
explicitly says the game will NOT do:

```
🔴 Anti-Pillar Violation
Anti-Pillar: "We will NOT have linear story progression — player defines their path"
main-quest.md: Defines a 12-chapter linear story with mandatory sequence
→ This system directly violates the defined anti-pillar.
```

### 3g: Player Fantasy Coherence

The player fantasies across all systems should be compatible — they should
reinforce a consistent identity for what the player IS in this game. Conflicting
player fantasies create identity confusion.

```
⚠️  Player Fantasy Conflict
combat.md: "You are a ruthless, precise warrior — every kill is earned"
dialogue.md: "You are a charismatic diplomat — violence is always avoidable"
exploration.md: "You are a reckless adventurer — diving in without a plan"
→ Three systems present incompatible identities. Players will feel the game
  doesn't know what it wants them to be. Consider: do these fantasies serve
  the same core identity from different angles, or do they genuinely conflict?
```

## Phase 5: Write Report and Flag GDDs

Ask: "May I write this review to `design/gdd/gdd-cross-review-[date].md`?"

If any GDDs are flagged for revision:

Ask: "Should I update the systems index to mark these GDDs as needing revision?"
- If yes: for each flagged GDD, update its Status field in systems-index.md
  to "Needs Revision" with a short note in the adjacent Notes/Description column.
  (Do NOT append parentheticals to the status value — other skills match "Needs Revision"
  as an exact string and parentheticals break that match.)
  Ask approval before writing.

---

## Phase 6: Handoff

After the report is written:

- **If FAIL**: "Resolve the blocking issues in the flagged GDDs, then re-run
  `/review-all-gdds` to confirm they're cleared before starting architecture."
- **If CONCERNS**: "Warnings are present but not blocking. You may proceed to
  `/create-architecture` and resolve warnings in parallel, or resolve them now
  for a cleaner baseline."
- **If PASS**: "GDDs are internally consistent. Run `/create-architecture` to
  begin translating the design into an engine-aware technical blueprint."

Gate reminder: `/gate-check technical-setup` now requires a PASS or CONCERNS
verdict from this review before architecture work can begin.

---

## Collaborative Protocol

1. **Read silently** — load all GDDs before presenting anything
2. **Show everything** — present the full consistency and design theory analysis
   before asking for any action
3. **Distinguish blocking from advisory** — not every issue needs to block
   architecture; be clear about which do
4. **Don't make design decisions** — flag contradictions and options, but never
   unilaterally decide which GDD is "right"
5. **Ask before writing** — confirm before writing the report or updating the
   systems index
6. **Be specific** — every issue must cite the exact GDD, section, and text
   involved; no vague warnings
