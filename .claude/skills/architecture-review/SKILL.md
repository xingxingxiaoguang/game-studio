# Architecture Review

The architecture review validates that the complete body of architectural decisions
covers all game design requirements, is internally consistent, and correctly targets
the project's pinned engine version. It is the quality gate between Technical Setup
and Pre-Production.

**Argument modes:**
- **No argument / `full`**: Full review — all phases
- **`coverage`**: Traceability only — which GDD requirements have no ADR
- **`consistency`**: Cross-ADR conflict detection only
- **`engine`**: Engine compatibility audit only
- **`single-gdd [path]`**: Review architecture coverage for one specific GDD

---

## Phase 1: Load Everything

Read all inputs before analysis:

### Design Documents
- All GDDs in `design/gdd/` — read every file completely
- `design/gdd/systems-index.md` — the authoritative list of systems

### Architecture Documents
- All ADRs in `docs/architecture/` — read every file completely
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` if it exists

### Engine Reference
- `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md`
- `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/breaking-changes.md`
- `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/deprecated-apis.md`
- All files in `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/modules/`

### Project Standards
- `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`

Report a count: "Loaded [N] GDDs, [M] ADRs, engine: [name + version]."

---

## Phase 2: Extract Technical Requirements from Every GDD

### Pre-load the TR Registry

Before extracting any requirements, read `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml`
if it exists. Index existing entries by `id` and by normalized `requirement`
text (lowercase, trimmed). This prevents ID renumbering across review runs.

For each requirement you extract, the matching rule is:
1. **Exact/near match** to an existing registry entry for the same system →
   reuse that entry's TR-ID unchanged. Update the `requirement` text in the
   registry only if the GDD wording changed (same intent, clearer phrasing) —
   add a `revised: [date]` field.
2. **No match** → assign a new ID: next available `TR-[system]-NNN` for that
   system, starting from the highest existing sequence + 1.
3. **Ambiguous** (partial match, intent unclear) → ask the user:
   > "Does '[new requirement text]' refer to the same requirement as
   > `TR-[system]-NNN: [existing text]'`, or is it a new requirement?"
   User answers: "Same requirement" (reuse ID) or "New requirement" (new ID).

For any requirement with `status: deprecated` in the registry — skip it.
It was removed from the GDD intentionally.

For each GDD, read it and extract all **technical requirements** — things the
architecture must provide for the system to work. A technical requirement is any
statement that implies a specific architectural decision.

Categories to extract:

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Data structures** | "Each entity has health, max health, status effects" → needs a component/data schema |
| **Performance constraints** | "Collision detection must run at 60fps with 200 entities" → physics budget ADR |
| **Engine capability** | "Inverse kinematics for character animation" → IK system ADR |
| **Cross-system communication** | "Damage system notifies UI and audio simultaneously" → event/signal architecture ADR |
| **State persistence** | "Player progress persists between sessions" → save system ADR |
| **Threading/timing** | "AI decisions happen off the main thread" → concurrency ADR |
| **Platform requirements** | "Supports keyboard, gamepad, touch" → input system ADR |

For each GDD, produce a structured list:

```
GDD: [filename]
System: [system name]
Technical Requirements:
  TR-[GDD]-001: [requirement text] → Domain: [Physics/Rendering/etc]
  TR-[GDD]-002: [requirement text] → Domain: [...]
```

This becomes the **requirements baseline** — the complete set of what the
architecture must cover.

---

## Phase 3: Build the Traceability Matrix

For each technical requirement extracted in Phase 2, search the ADRs:

1. Read every ADR's "GDD Requirements Addressed" section
2. Check if it explicitly references the requirement or its GDD
3. Check if the ADR's decision text implicitly covers the requirement
4. Mark coverage status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ **Covered** | An ADR explicitly addresses this requirement |
| ⚠️ **Partial** | An ADR partially covers this, or coverage is ambiguous |
| ❌ **Gap** | No ADR addresses this requirement |

Build the full matrix:

```
## Traceability Matrix

| Requirement ID | GDD | System | Requirement | ADR Coverage | Status |
|---------------|-----|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| TR-combat-001 | combat.md | Combat | Hitbox detection < 1 frame | ADR-0003 | ✅ |
| TR-combat-002 | combat.md | Combat | Combo window timing | — | ❌ GAP |
| TR-inventory-001 | inventory.md | Inventory | Persistent item storage | ADR-0005 | ✅ |
```

Count the totals: X covered, Y partial, Z gaps.

---

## Phase 4: Cross-ADR Conflict Detection

Compare every ADR against every other ADR to detect contradictions. A conflict
exists when:

- **Data ownership conflict**: Two ADRs claim exclusive ownership of the same data
- **Integration contract conflict**: ADR-A assumes System X has interface Y, but
  ADR-B defines System X with a different interface
- **Performance budget conflict**: ADR-A allocates N ms to physics, ADR-B allocates
  N ms to AI, together they exceed the total frame budget
- **Dependency cycle**: ADR-A says System X initialises before Y; ADR-B says Y
  initialises before X
- **Architecture pattern conflict**: ADR-A uses event-driven communication for a
  subsystem; ADR-B uses direct function calls to the same subsystem
- **State management conflict**: Two ADRs define authority over the same game state
  (e.g. both Combat ADR and Character ADR claim to own the health value)

For each conflict found:

```
## Conflict: [ADR-NNNN] vs [ADR-MMMM]
Type: [Data ownership / Integration / Performance / Dependency / Pattern / State]
ADR-NNNN claims: [...]
ADR-MMMM claims: [...]
Impact: [What breaks if both are implemented as written]
Resolution options:
  1. [Option A]
  2. [Option B]
```

### ADR Dependency Ordering

After conflict detection, analyse the dependency graph across all ADRs:

1. **Collect all `Depends On` fields** from every ADR's "ADR Dependencies" section
2. **Topological sort**: Determine the correct implementation order — ADRs with no
   dependencies come first (Foundation), ADRs that depend on those come next, etc.
3. **Flag unresolved dependencies**: If ADR-A's "Depends On" field references an ADR
   that is still `Proposed` or does not exist, flag it:
   ```
   ⚠️  ADR-0005 depends on ADR-0002 — but ADR-0002 is still Proposed.
       ADR-0005 cannot be safely implemented until ADR-0002 is Accepted.
   ```
4. **Cycle detection**: If ADR-A depends on ADR-B and ADR-B depends on ADR-A (directly
   or transitively), flag it as a `DEPENDENCY CYCLE`:
   ```
   🔴 DEPENDENCY CYCLE: ADR-0003 → ADR-0006 → ADR-0003
      This cycle must be broken before either can be implemented.
   ```
5. **Output recommended implementation order**:
   ```
   ### Recommended ADR Implementation Order (topologically sorted)
   Foundation (no dependencies):
     1. ADR-0001: [title]
     2. ADR-0003: [title]
   Depends on Foundation:
     3. ADR-0002: [title] (requires ADR-0001)
     4. ADR-0005: [title] (requires ADR-0003)
   Feature layer:
     5. ADR-0004: [title] (requires ADR-0002, ADR-0005)
   ```

---

## Phase 5: Engine Compatibility Cross-Check

Across all ADRs, check for engine consistency:

### Version Consistency
- Do all ADRs that mention an engine version agree on the same version?
- If any ADR was written for an older engine version, flag it as potentially stale

### Post-Cutoff API Consistency
- Collect all "Post-Cutoff APIs Used" fields from all ADRs
- For each, verify against the relevant module reference doc
- Check that no two ADRs make contradictory assumptions about the same post-cutoff API

### Deprecated API Check
- Grep all ADRs for API names listed in `deprecated-apis.md`
- Flag any ADR referencing a deprecated API

### Missing Engine Compatibility Sections
- List all ADRs that are missing the Engine Compatibility section entirely
- These are blind spots — their engine assumptions are unknown

Output format:
```
### Engine Audit Results
Engine: [name + version]
ADRs with Engine Compatibility section: X / Y total

Deprecated API References:
  - ADR-0002: uses [deprecated API] — deprecated since [version]

Stale Version References:
  - ADR-0001: written for [older version] — current project version is [version]

Post-Cutoff API Conflicts:
  - ADR-0004 and ADR-0007 both use [API] with incompatible assumptions
```

---

## Phase 5b: Design Revision Flags (Architecture → GDD Feedback)

For each **HIGH RISK engine finding** from Phase 5, check whether any GDD makes an
assumption that the verified engine reality contradicts.

Specific cases to check:

1. **Post-cutoff API behaviour differs from training-data assumptions**: If an ADR
   records a verified API behaviour that differs from the default LLM assumption,
   check all GDDs that reference the related system. Look for design rules written
   around the old (assumed) behaviour.

2. **Known engine limitations in ADRs**: If an ADR records a known engine limitation
   (e.g. "Jolt ignores HingeJoint3D damp", "D3D12 is now the default backend"), check
   GDDs that design mechanics around the affected feature.

3. **Deprecated API conflicts**: If Phase 5 flagged a deprecated API used in an ADR,
   check whether any GDD contains mechanics that assume the deprecated API's behaviour.

For each conflict found, record it in the GDD Revision Flags table:

```
### GDD Revision Flags (Architecture → Design Feedback)
These GDD assumptions conflict with verified engine behaviour or accepted ADRs.
The GDD should be revised before its system enters implementation.

| GDD | Assumption | Reality (from ADR/engine-reference) | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| combat.md | "Use HingeJoint3D damp for weapon recoil" | Jolt ignores damp — ADR-0003 | Revise GDD |
```

If no revision flags are found, write: "No GDD revision flags — all GDD assumptions
are consistent with verified engine behaviour."

Ask: "Should I flag these GDDs for revision in the systems index?"
- If yes: update the relevant systems' Status field to "Needs Revision"
  and add a short inline note in the adjacent Notes/Description column explaining the conflict.
  Ask for approval before writing.
  (Do NOT use parentheticals like "Needs Revision (Architecture Feedback)" — other skills
  match the exact string "Needs Revision" and parentheticals break that match.)

---

## Phase 6: Architecture Document Coverage

If `docs/architecture/architecture.md` exists, validate it against GDDs:

- Does every system from `systems-index.md` appear in the architecture layers?
- Does the data flow section cover all cross-system communication defined in GDDs?
- Do the API boundaries support all integration requirements from GDDs?
- Are there systems in the architecture doc that have no corresponding GDD
  (orphaned architecture)?

---

## Phase 7: Output the Review Report

```
## Architecture Review Report
Date: [date]
Engine: [name + version]
GDDs Reviewed: [N]
ADRs Reviewed: [M]

---

```

---

## Phase 8: Write and Update Traceability Index

Ask: "May I write this review to `docs/architecture/architecture-review-[date].md`?"

Also ask: "May I update `docs/architecture/architecture-traceability.md` with the
current matrix? This is the living index that future reviews update incrementally."

### TR Registry Update

Also ask: "May I update `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` with new requirement
IDs from this review?"

If yes:
- **Append** any new TR-IDs that weren't in the registry before this review
- **Update** `requirement` text and `revised` date for any entries whose GDD
  wording changed (ID stays the same)
- **Mark** `status: deprecated` for any registry entries whose GDD requirement
  no longer exists (confirm with user before marking deprecated)
- **Never** renumber or delete existing entries
- Update the `last_updated` and `version` fields at the top

This ensures all future story files can reference stable TR-IDs that persist
across every subsequent architecture review.

The traceability index format:

```markdown
# Architecture Traceability Index
Last Updated: [date]
Engine: [name + version]

## Coverage Summary
- Total requirements: [N]
- Covered: [X] ([%])
- Partial: [Y]
- Gaps: [Z]

## Full Matrix
[Complete traceability matrix from Phase 3]

## Known Gaps
[All ❌ items with suggested ADRs]

## Superseded Requirements
[Requirements whose GDD was changed after the ADR was written]
```

---

## Phase 9: Handoff

After completing the review:

1. **Immediate actions**: List the top 3 ADRs to create (highest-impact gaps first,
   Foundation layer before Feature layer)
2. **Gate guidance**: "When all blocking issues are resolved, run `/gate-check
   pre-production` to advance"
3. **Rerun trigger**: "Re-run `/architecture-review` after each new ADR is written
   to verify coverage improves"

---

## Collaborative Protocol

1. **Read silently** — do not narrate every file read
2. **Show the matrix** — present the full traceability matrix before asking for
   anything; let the user see the state
3. **Don't guess** — if a requirement is ambiguous, ask: "Is [X] a technical
   requirement or a design preference?"
4. **Ask before writing** — always confirm before writing the report file
5. **Non-blocking** — the verdict is advisory; the user decides whether to continue
   despite CONCERNS or even FAIL findings
